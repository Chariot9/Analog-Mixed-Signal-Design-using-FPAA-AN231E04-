FPAA-Based Analog & Mixed-Signal Circuit Design
Summer Research Internship @ IIT (ISM) Dhanbad
May 2025 – July 2025

This repository contains the presentation (PPT) and project report from my Summer Research Internship at the Analog & Mixed-Signal Laboratory, IIT (ISM) Dhanbad.
The internship focused on designing, implementing, and analyzing analog and mixed-signal circuits using:

Field Programmable Analog Array (FPAA) – AN231E04 (Anadigm)

Analog Discovery Kit (Digilent) with WaveForms

AnadigmDesigner2 Software

WaveForms Tools (Oscilloscope, Network Analyzer, WaveGen)

This work demonstrates hands-on experience in reconfigurable analog design, waveform analysis, and hardware validation.

 Project Overview

The project involved two major components:

1. Analog Discovery Kit-Based Experiments

Implemented and analyzed foundational analog circuits:

Inverting & Non-Inverting Amplifiers

Integrator / Low-Pass Filter

Bode Plot – Frequency & Phase Response

Diode I–V Characteristics

PNP Transistor Characteristics

Sallen-Key Low-Pass Filter

Biquad Filter

These experiments helped validate theoretical concepts through real-time waveform measurement and frequency analysis.

2. FPAA-Based Reconfigurable Analog Circuits

Designed and implemented advanced analog signal-processing circuits on the AN231E04 FPAA:

Full-Wave Rectifier

Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO)

Phase Shift Detector

Schmitt Trigger with Hysteresis

Square Wave Oscillator

Gilbert Multiplier (Analog Multiplier)

Key capabilities demonstrated:

Dynamic reconfiguration without hardware rewiring

Switched-capacitor analog design

Real-time waveform validation using Analog Discovery Kit

Hardware-level prototyping for mixed-signal systems
